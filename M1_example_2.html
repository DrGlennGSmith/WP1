<!--This is an example of inline styling.  We changed the color of the h1 element in this one instance.-->
<h1 style="color:#FF0080; font-family:Arial;">My first heading</h1>

<!--This h1 would be black.  This style will only be applied to what you applied it to.-->  <!--Wouldn't it be obnoxious to have to do this over and over again?-->
<h1 style="color:#D67D94; font-family:Verdana;">My second heading.</h1>    
    
<p style="color:#D4AF37; font-family:Tahoma;">My first paragraph</p>
